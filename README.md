# DX11-Engine
My progress on creating a DirectX11 Engine and learning the basics of building the engine. Nothing exiting...

Following the tutorials of RasterTek, keeping track of handy notes and things in an OneNote file, aswell as future ideas for the actual usage.


# Model Converter
So far I have just been using the RasterTek model converter tutorial as base for my converter.
I have adjusted a few simple things, and the only real addition right now is the fact that my model converter will actually name the output file.

input file: [name].obj

output file: [name].txt
